## Technique Sessions

### Session 1: Role Playing (Operator Perspective)

**Scenario:** Operator on active call checking bonfire map when flash message arrives: "Trenger BAPS"

**Key Insights from Operator Viewpoint:**
- Flash messages need immediate attention WITHOUT disrupting active phone calls
- Visual-only notifications (no sound/vibration) essential for call center environment
- Smart detection needed - don't interrupt when operator is actively typing
- Clear hierarchy: Flash > Bonfire Map > Other info
- Multiple message management with clear indicators

**Design Decisions:**
- 3 quick blinks of entire application for attention
- Continuous blinking of message line until acknowledged
- Top-of-screen dedicated message field
- Newest message always displayed first
- Visual indicator for multiple messages
- No audio, no vibration

### Session 2: Six Thinking Hats (Multi-Perspective Analysis)

**White Hat (Facts):**
- 4 operators on duty simultaneously
- 10 flash messages per shift average (range: 0-30)
- Only 1/4 of one 49" monitor available (2560x1440 @ 125% scaling)
- S111/S112 toggle multiple times per shift
- Flash messages: max one short sentence
- "Hva skjer" messages: 1-3 sentences

**Red Hat (Emotions):**
- Design feels right and appropriate for emergency context
- Confident operators will adopt it
- Comfortable with workflow simplicity

**Yellow Hat (Benefits):**
- Structured information architecture separating urgent from informational
- Instant operator-to-operator communication without phone/email
- Visual clarity without audio disruption
- Wall screen redundancy ensures visibility
- Smart typing detection prevents work interruption
- Workload balancing for S111/S112 vehicles

**Black Hat (Risks & Mitigation):**
- Alert Fatigue → Mitigated: All flash messages are Priority 1 event-related
- Accidental Sends → Mitigated: Easy to dismiss, not critical
- Auto-Switch Disruption → Mitigated: Smart typing detection + tab blink alternative
- Network Lag → Mitigated: 1-second delay acceptable (operators often on phone)
- Data Loss → Mitigated: Standard database reliability + audit logging

**Green Hat (Creative Enhancements):**
- Priority system for "Hva Skjer" messages (originally 3 levels, refined to 2)
- Wall screen as shared admin user with same web application
- Native application appearance (no browser chrome)

**Blue Hat (Process Overview):**
- Confirmed comprehensive design covering all operational scenarios
- Identified need for deployment strategy change (covered separately)

### Session 3: SCAMPER (Systematic Refinement)

**Substitute:** Evaluated alternatives - kept original designs
**Combine:** Considered integrations - kept systems separate for focus
**Adapt:** Reviewed other emergency systems - current design appropriate
**Modify:** Assessed sizing - current scale optimal
**Put to other uses:** Explored additional features - kept focused on core functionality
**Eliminate:** **SIMPLIFIED** - Removed Pri 2 (Yellow), kept only Pri 1 (Red/Critical) + Normal
**Reverse:** Evaluated opposite approaches - confirmed current flow optimal

## Major Features Discovered

### 1. Flash Message System (NEW FEATURE)

**Purpose:** Urgent operator-to-operator communication for time-critical events

**Visual Behavior:**
- Dedicated message field at top of screen
- 3 quick blinks of entire application (attention grab)
- Continuous blinking of message line until acknowledged
- Click to stop blinking and read message
- Newest message always displayed first
- Clear indicator when multiple messages exist
- Show 3 most recent messages, scroll/paginate for older messages

**Interaction:**
- No sender identification (anonymous broadcast)
- Immediate action priority
- Persistent blinking until acknowledged
- Two-interface design: Read area + Write area
- Write interface located inside Flash folder
- No reply function - write new message instead

**Smart Behavior:**
- Auto-switch all operators to Flash folder when message sent
- UNLESS operator is actively typing - then Flash tab blinks instead
- Auto-return to "Hva Skjer" folder after 5 minutes of inactivity
- Manual folder switching always available

**Settings:**
- Adjustable blink intensity (prevent overstimulation)
- Flash messages take display priority

**Example Use Cases:**
- "Trenger BAPS" (backup request)
- "Pause om 5 min" (break coordination)
- "S111 ute av drift" (vehicle status alert)

### 2. Bilstatus Management System (NEW FEATURE)

**Purpose:** Track and balance workload between station vehicles S111 and S112

**Status Logic:**
- **Green** = Next to respond (ready)
- **Red** = Standby (second vehicle)
- **Grey** = Out of service (with note)

**Business Rules:**
- Never both same color
- S111 green → S112 red (and vice versa)
- If one grey → other MUST be green
- Manual toggle by clicking box

**Out-of-Service Management:**
- Right-click box → "Skal den settes i grå?"
- Dialog box appears for note entry
- Common notes: "Dekkskift", "Mangler mannskaper", "På øvelse"
- Edit note anytime while grey
- Cancel grey status → returns to red/green rotation

**Visual Design:**
- Clear, large boxes with vehicle ID prominently displayed
- Located top-right of "Hva Skjer" folder
- Below bilstatus: Vaktplan (duty roster)

**Access Control:**
- All operators can read and edit
- Not safety-critical (workload balancing, not dispatch)
- Manual operation (can fail if operators forget to toggle)

### 3. Wall Screen Application (NEW COMPONENT)

**Purpose:** Shared display visible to all operators for critical flash messages

**Technical Implementation:**
- Same web application as operator version (unified codebase)
- Deployed on large screen wall in front of operators
- Shared admin user login (credentials known by all operators)

**Behavior:**
- Always displays flash messages with blinking
- Shows flash regardless of individual operator's current folder
- Auto-return to "Hva Skjer" display 5 minutes after last flash
- Ensures redundancy - operators can't miss critical messages

### 4. Folder/Tab Navigation Structure

**Architecture:** Excel-style tabs at very top of application

**Folders:**
1. **Hva Skjer** (Main/Default Home)
   - Viktige meldinger (left side - entire column)
   - Bilstatus (top-right - S111/S112 boxes)
   - Vaktplan (below bilstatus - duty roster)

2. **Flash** (Urgent Communications)
   - Message read interface
   - Message write interface
   - Message history (scroll/paginate)

3. **Bålmelding** (Bonfire Map)
   - Google Maps integration
   - Registered bonfire notifications

4. **Innstillinger** (Settings)
   - Flash intensity adjustment
   - Other system preferences

**Navigation Behavior:**
- Default landing: "Hva Skjer"
- Flash arrival: Auto-switch to Flash folder (unless typing)
- Auto-return: Back to "Hva Skjer" after 5 minutes
- Manual switching: Always available via top tabs

### 5. Priority System for "Hva Skjer" Messages

**Purpose:** Visual prioritization of informational messages

**Priority Levels (SIMPLIFIED):**
- **Pri 1 (Red/Critical)** - Manually marked as critical, requires immediate awareness
- **Normal (Default)** - Standard operational information

**Originally Considered:**
- Pri 1 (Red), Pri 2 (Yellow), Pri 3 (Green)
- Simplified during SCAMPER to reduce complexity

**Visual Design:**
- Color-coded indicators for quick scanning
- Messages span hours/days ahead (not seconds like Flash)
- All operators can create, edit, and delete

**Example Messages:**
- Pri 1: "Veiarbeid E39 - full stenging kl 14:00 i dag"
- Normal: "Røyktest Forus torsdag kl 10-12"
- Normal: "Gasskjele Åsgard - fakkling fredag natt"

### 6. Audit Logging System (REQUIREMENT)

**Purpose:** Full accountability and traceability for all system actions

**Tracked Actions:**
- Who created "Hva skjer" messages
- Who edited "Hva skjer" messages
- Who deleted "Hva skjer" messages
- Who toggled bilstatus (S111/S112)
- Who set vehicle grey + note content
- Who sent flash messages (if needed for accountability)

**Technical Requirements:**
- Database-level audit trail
- Timestamp all actions
- Store user identity
- Store before/after values for edits
- Retention aligned with proposal (1 year operational data)

**Access:**
- Read-only for operators
- Query/report capability for management
- Support incident investigation and training

### 7. Application Design Philosophy

**Visual Identity:**
- Must look and feel like standalone native application
- NOT "web-app" aesthetic
- Professional emergency services aesthetic

**Technical Implementation:**
- Opens in Edge browser
- **No browser UI chrome** (no address bar, favorites bar, tabs, bookmarks)
- Fullscreen app mode or PWA (Progressive Web App)
- Custom title bar with application branding

**Rationale:**
- Maximize screen real estate for operational data
- Eliminate visual clutter
- Professional appearance builds operator confidence
- Browser UI elements "steal space" from critical information

**Potential Implementation:**
- Launch as PWA
- Edge app mode: `msedge.exe --app=https://url --kiosk`
- Custom styling to match emergency services context

   - No reply function in Flash - write new message instead
   - Bilstatus not safety-critical - simple workload balancing
   - Focus beats feature bloat in high-stress environments

4. **Redundancy and Reliability**
   - Wall screen ensures visibility even if operator misses individual notification
   - Audit logging provides accountability and training material
   - 1-second network lag acceptable - operators often on phone anyway
   - Manual fallback for all automated systems

5. **Design for Operators, Not Engineers**
   - Role playing revealed operator needs clearly
   - "Native app feel" matters for professional confidence
   - Color-coding (green/red/grey) faster than text labels
   - Excel-style tabs familiar and intuitive

## Action Planning

### Top 3 Priority Ideas

#### #1 Priority: Flash Message System

**Rationale:**
- Highest value-add feature not in original proposal
- Solves real operational communication gap
- Directly improves emergency response coordination
- Operators currently use informal channels (phone, shouting)

**Next Steps:**
1. Design database schema for flash messages (sender, message, timestamp, acknowledged_by)
2. Implement real-time WebSocket or Server-Sent Events for operator synchronization
3. Build blink animation system (3 quick blinks → continuous blink)
4. Implement smart typing detection to prevent disruption
5. Create message history with pagination
6. Build auto-return timer (5 minutes to "Hva Skjer")
7. Test with multiple browser tabs simulating 4 operators

**Resources Needed:**
- Real-time communication library (Socket.io, Pusher, or native WebSockets)
- State management for blink animations (React Context or Zustand)
- Browser API for typing detection (keyboard event listeners)
- Timer management (setTimeout/setInterval with cleanup)

**Timeline:** Week 3-4 (after core navigation and layout in place)

#### #2 Priority: Folder Navigation + "Hva Skjer" Layout

**Rationale:**
- Foundation for entire application architecture
- Must be in place before any other features
- Establishes information hierarchy and workflow
- Quick to implement compared to value delivered

2. **Prototype Testing** - Get operator feedback on clickable mockups
3. **Six Thinking Hats (with operators)** - Run same analysis with actual users

### Questions That Emerged

**Operational Questions:**
1. What happens during shift change? Do flash messages persist across shifts?
2. Should there be a "Do Not Disturb" mode for operators during critical calls?
3. How do operators currently communicate "Trenger BAPS"? (phone? radio? verbal?)
4. What's the protocol when both S111 and S112 are out of service?
5. Should bilstatus auto-suggest toggle based on dispatch history?

**Technical Questions:**
1. What's acceptable flash message latency? (1 second? 3 seconds? 5 seconds?)
2. Should flash messages be encrypted for sensitive operational communications?
3. How long should flash message history be retained? (24 hours? 7 days? 30 days?)
4. Should wall screen have independent authentication or auto-login?
5. What happens if Google OAuth provider is down? Fallback authentication?

**Deployment Questions (addressed separately):**
1. Vercel vs other cloud hosting (Railway, Render, Fly.io)?
2. Database hosting (Vercel Postgres vs separate provider)?
3. Cost estimation for cloud hosting during 6-week project?
4. Migration path from cloud to on-premises when server access granted?

## Deployment Strategy Change (Critical)

**MAJOR ARCHITECTURE REVISION IDENTIFIED:**

During brainstorming, a critical deployment constraint was discovered:

### Original Plan (from proposal.md):
- On-premises Windows Server 2019+
- IIS 10+ with iisnode
- Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) authentication
- Internal network only (plus public portal at www.rogbr.no)

### Revised Plan (student project reality):
- **Cloud hosting:** Vercel (or similar: Railway, Render, Fly.io)
- **Authentication:** Google OAuth with operator whitelist
- **Bonfire registration:** Google OAuth via special link (not public form)
- **Database:** Cloud-hosted PostgreSQL (Vercel Postgres, Supabase, or Neon)

### Rationale for Change:
- No access to work servers during 6-week student project timeline
- Need functional system for demonstration and testing
- Cloud deployment enables easier development and collaboration
- Google OAuth simpler to implement than Microsoft Entra ID for students
- Migration to on-premises possible after project completion

### Trade-offs Accepted:
- **Flash message latency:** Cloud hosting adds network latency vs on-premises
  - Estimated impact: 100-500ms additional latency
  - Mitigation: Optimize WebSocket connections, use edge functions
  - Acceptable for initial version
- **Authentication change:** Google OAuth vs Microsoft Entra ID
  - Whitelist management by project owner
  - All operators need Google accounts
  - Migration path to Microsoft Entra ID for production deployment
- **Bonfire registration authentication:** No longer public form
  - Requires Google login via special link
  - Reduces spam/abuse
  - Slightly higher friction for citizen registration
  - Trade-off acceptable for student project scope

### Implementation Impact:
- **proposal.md must be updated** with revised deployment strategy
- Next.js configuration adjusted for Vercel deployment
- NextAuth.js configured for Google OAuth provider
- Database connection strings for cloud PostgreSQL
- Environment variable management via Vercel dashboard
- No IIS/Windows Server configuration needed
