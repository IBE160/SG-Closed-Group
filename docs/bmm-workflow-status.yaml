# NOTES:
# ======
# - This is a Level 2 project (Medium Project: 5-15 stories)
# - Following BMad Method track for greenfield projects
# - Architecture is highly recommended for UI-heavy projects like this
# - UX Design is conditional (if_has_ui) - required for this emergency response UI
# - Phase 4 implementation uses sprint-status.yaml for detailed story tracking
# - Research workflow to be completed retroactively for technical decision documentation
